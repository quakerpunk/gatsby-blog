[When There Wasn’t Enough Hand Sanitizer, Distilleries Stepped Up. Now They’re Facing $14,060 FDA Fees. – Reason.com](https://reason.com/2020/12/30/when-there-wasnt-enough-hand-sanitizer-distilleries-stepped-up-now-theyre-facing-14060-fda-fees)

> At issue is a provision of the CARES Act that reformed regulation of non-prescription drugs. Under the revised law, distilleries that produced sanitizer have been classified as "over-the-counter drug monograph facilities." [The CARES Act also enacted user fees on these facilities to fund the FDA's regulatory activities](https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/over-counter-monograph-user-fee-program-omufa). For small distillers, that means ending the year with a surprise bill for $14,060 due on February 11.
