### April 16

The word came down today. Judge Clay Jenkins says Dallas County residents are **required** to wear a face covering of some kind when out and about...a decree that won't be enforced. Yeah, it's a real head-scratcher. I've been using a basic mask while working on my new house, but it's raggedy. Guess I'll have to upgrade now.

Today, DART joined with other transit agencies to honor those serving on the front lines of this crisis by sounding their horns. I didn't hear any, but there aren't many bus routes by me.
