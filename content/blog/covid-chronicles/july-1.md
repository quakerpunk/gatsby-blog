[Austin City Limits cancels 2020 music festival](https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/austin-city-limits-2020-canceled-acl-coronavirus/269-82ba054e-10b4-4c6e-affc-cfc82e81788e)

> Austin City Limits Music Festival will no longer take place in 2020. We would have loved to put on another memorable show this year, however, with the uncertainty surrounding the current situation in Texas, this decision is the only responsible solution. The health and safety of our fans, artists, partners, staff and the entire Austin community remains our highest priority.
