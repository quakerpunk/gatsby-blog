Hey! Long time no blog.

I've been busy this past month or so. I moved! And I've been busy getting that sorted out.

A quick recap...Dallas County was doing okay with a plateau around 250 or so cases until last week, when the cases spike to roughly 290-300. Testing capacity has increased, so those numbers above don't tell the whole story; the true indicators are deaths and hospital admissions for COVID-19.

Of course, we may be in for another spike as we've had our share of protests in the wake of George Floyd's death at the hands of former police officer Derek Chauvin. We even had a curfew imposed at one point, but activity has died down and authorities lifted the curfew.

I've been following the debate over protesting vs. following social distancing procedures. I'm finding ways to do both, mainly online. The missus and I are still hunkering down and laying low until August, provided another wave of positive cases doesn't swell.

I'll try to get back on tracking daily cases and notable news items as best I can.
