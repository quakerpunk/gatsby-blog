### April 30

- Dallas County: 3,531 total cases, 179 new cases, and 5 deaths.

I think this is the worst day so far for new cases, but there's a good reason:

50 died across the State of Texas today, the state's deadliest day.

I've been a fan of Martin Gurri's work, since he released the 1st edition of the Revolt of the Public. He's still hard at work and wrote this [essay yesterday](https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/commentary/great-reset-marc-mndreessens-recent-exhortation-to-build-is-exactly-right).

> The coming reset will provide an opportunity to “reboot the American dream.” For Andreessen, the time has come to build. That is his theme and his challenge to both poles of the political spectrum. The right should support a private sector that invests aggressively “in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science.” The left should expect the public sector to “build better hospitals, better schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing.”

You can find more of his writing at [the fifth wave](https://thefifthwave.wordpress.com/). And be sure to grab the 2nd Edition of the Revolt of the Public on Amazon.

That segues nicely into this bit o' madness:

It feels like Texas is holding its breath. The stay-at-home order expires tomorrow and businesses are nervous to embrace the opportunity to open their doors.

[Drive-in theaters are ready](https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/north-texas-drive-in-movie-theaters-open-for-business/287-6522a50f-f07c-4b4c-8787-24051e9bbdf9), though.

> Coyote Drive-In in Fort Worth will be reopening on May 1, and Galaxy Drive-In, near Ennis, has stayed open for most of the coronavirus pandemic.
>
> This weekend, Coyote Drive-In will feature showings of the first "The Fast and the Furious" movie, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," "Trolls: World Tour" and "Sonic the Hedgehog."
>
> Galaxy is also showing "Trolls," as well as "Fantasy Island," "Bloodshot," "The Invisible Man," "The Hunt" and "Underwater."

A little mix of old and new. But why? (_Emphasis added_)

> But most movie theaters make money off of new movies, not repertory screenings, and a new wide-release film hasn't hit theaters since **March 13**.

Wow, has it been that long?

No matter what the future holds, we'll keep reaching for the stars.
