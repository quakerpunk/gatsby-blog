This morning, Governor Greg Abbott amended his executive order to stop jailing business owners who violate local shelter-in-place orders and reopen their businesses ahead of schedule. That includes local salon owner Shelley Luther and two Laredo-area salon owners:

The Governor in his announcement made a good point: it doesn't make sense to release prisoners due to COVID-19, then turn around and lock up business owners who defy shelter-in-place orders. See Below

Then, the Texas Supreme Court decided to release Luther:

Now it's important to note that she wasn't in jail because she violated the Governor's executive order, nor does the amendment exonerate her. She violated a judge's order, at least according to this:

Make sense?

No word on if authorities will rescind the fine or if the Supreme Court will release the salon owners from Laredo.

> The NBA has informed all of its franchises that their facilities may open on Friday and be used on a voluntary basis by up to four individual players, as long as local or state guidelines are followed.
