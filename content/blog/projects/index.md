Let’s digress from the current unpleasantness for a moment. Here are some projects on the horizon for me — personal projects that I want to work on. 

## The Smartening of My New House

This is the big one. A brand spanking new house in 2020 needs some kind of smart capability. 

One rule: the missus and I don’t want to farm this out to the cloud. No Amazon, no Google, no Nest, no Nest by Google, and [definitely not Wink](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249950/smart-home-platform-wink-monthly-subscription). That means setting up [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) locally, along with a network of Z-Wave devices.

Why Z-Wave? While it’s a proprietary protocol, I’ll know that these devices will have no trouble taking with one another. With Zigbee, that’s not a certainty. 

I’m planning on seeing how we use the house for 6 months so I can get an idea of which switches we use the most. Then, update those with Z-Wave switches. 

I’ve also wanted a massive home server. The plan is for a server based on [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) with services running in Docker. Those services would include:

- Home Assistant
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)
- Pi-Hole?
- [Huginn](https://github.com/huginn/huginn)?
- Something for automated backups (a la Time Machine)
- Something to store video captured from security cameras 

Stay tuned. 

## The Fortification of My New House 

Fortification is a strong word, but given [events in early 2020](covid-chronicles), it’s appropriate. Now I’m not trying to turn our happy home into a prepper’s bunker, but we are talking security cameras outside and a comfortable environment inside, along with some other creature comforts:

- The missus is interested in a whole house backup generator. Do we invest in that?
- Our neighbor has a solar cell array. Do we invest in that?
- Do I slap a UV light on the air intake of our A/C units? It kills germs.

## Writing Gooder with 1Writer

I recently discovered the [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) NodeJS module and I’d like to create a 1Writer action that uses it. I’ve made some progress, but need to finalize the UI. 

## Netlify to Discord

Someday, I will give money to Netlify. But until and even then, it would be nice to set up a bot of some kind to notify me on Discord when a build has completed or failed. 

## Finding a Reliable VPN

It’s getting more and more crucial to find a VPN, just for simple web browsing. Our Senators and Representatives have an old fashioned view of technology and, as a result, don’t always legislate well. 

Currently, I’m putting [Tunnel Bear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/) through its paces. It’s not bad. I get browser add-ons and an iPhone app and both are easy to use. I have no complaints so far. 

I think I’ll try [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) next.
