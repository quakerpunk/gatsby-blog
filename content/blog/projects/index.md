Let’s digress from the current unpleasantness for a moment. Here are some projects on the horizon for me — personal projects that I want to work on. 

## The Smartening of My New House

This is the big one. A brand spanking new house in 2020 needs some kind of smart capability. 

One rule: the missus and I don’t want to farm this out to the cloud. No Amazon, no Google, no Nest, no Nest by Google, and [definitely not Wink](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249950/smart-home-platform-wink-monthly-subscription). That means setting up [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) locally. 

I’ve also wanted a massive file server that houses movies in [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), stores any music files we’ve purchased, and serve as a Time Machine vault. 

Stay tuned. 

## The Fortification of My New House 

Fortification is a strong word. No, we’re not talking machine gun turrets or boiling oil. We’re talking security cameras outside, air cleaning inside. 

Do we invest in a whole house backup generator? 

Do we invest in solar cells?

Do I slap a UV light on the air intake of our A/C units?

## Writing Gooder with 1Writer

I recently discovered the [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) NodeJS module and I’d like to create a 1Writer action that uses it. I’ve made some progress, but need to finalize the UI. 

## Netlify to Discord

Someday, I will give money to Netlify. But until and even then, it would be nice to set up a bot of some kind to notify me on Discord when a build has completed or failed. 

## Finding a Reliable VPN

It’s getting more and more crucial to find a VPN, just for simple web browsing. Our Senators and Representatives have an old fashioned view of technology and, as a result, don’t always legislate well. 

Currently, I’m putting [Tunnel Bear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/) through its paces. It’s not bad. I get browser add-ons and an iPhone app and both are easy to use. I have no complaints so far. 

I think I’ll try [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) next.
