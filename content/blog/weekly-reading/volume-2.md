[Study: Folklore structure reveals how conspiracy theories emerge, fall apart](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/study-folklore-structure-reveals-how-conspiracy-theories-emerge-fall-apart/)

> Tangherlini and his co-authors at the University of California, Los Angeles, combined their knowledge of folklore with machine learning to analyze some 18,000 posts from Reddit and [Voat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voat) discussion boards between April 2016 and February 2018, pertaining to the [thoroughly debunked](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html) conspiracy theory dubbed "[Pizzagate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory)." They then used that data to produce a graphic representation of the emerging narratives, with multiple layers representing the various subplots. Relationships between key people ("actants"), places, things, organizations, and other elements were indicated by connecting lines within and among those layers.

> Granted, thereâ€™s a lot of noise in social media forums, with plenty of irrelevant pieces. But the AI enabled Tangherlini et al. to tease out the hidden narratives that fed into the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and determine the difference between the storytelling elements of a debunked conspiracy and a fact-based real-world conspiracy.
